# Codam.app

Codam.app is a repository of applications which are normally difficult to
install on a Codam iMac because of the inability to mount `.dmg`s.

## Downloading

You can find the latest downloads on the
[Releases](https://github.com/nloomans/Codam.app/releases) page.

## Requesting an .app

Create a separate issue for every app you want to add. Put the app name in the
title for easy searching.

Requirements for inclusion:

 - Must not be installable using homebrew.

## Visual Studio Code
